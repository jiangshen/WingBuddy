> It is late at night, you are at a party. Everything is perfect people, music and the atmosphere. You dance and flow through the crowd. Eventually, you meet someone special and show her your best moves. She likes you and joins you. You guys have lots of fun and decide to go back to your place (to look at your vintage computer games collection). But there is a problem... You are a college student. Which means that you are living with a roommate... Going to back to your place seemed like a great idea until you remember that. You never know your room is available or not, your roommate is quite unpredictable.  

Thanks to CodeMonkeys WingBuddy comes to the rescue!
